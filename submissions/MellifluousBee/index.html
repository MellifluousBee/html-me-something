            <h1> Wrecked &copy Skillshare </h1>
            <h3>This is a loosely organized safe space to empower womyn to work on their own
                homes, learn new skills, and teach other womyn as they learn. It is based on a model
                that allows knowledge to be passed immediately after it is learned, rather than waiting
                for expertise to share knowledge.</h3>

                <h3>I encourage anyone in the group to start a skillshare any time (even if you haven't participated yet)
                by setting a date through our closed facebook group.  Even if you just need extra hands or don't quite
                know what you are doing and need to find help. Please just be clear about what you intend. </h3>

                    <h4> Project #1-Tuckpointing with Kesia </h4>
                    <img src="images/tuckpointingtools.jpg" />
                    <p>We had a huge turnout for the first skillshare. There wasn't really enough time but everyone got a turn.</p>
                    <p>We learned how to scrape old mortar with various tools </p>
                    <p>We learned how to mix mortar to the right consistency.</p>
                    <p>We practiced techniques for repointing the bricks.</p>

                    <h4> Project #2- Insulating Pex with Mel </h4>
                    <img src="images/pipeinsulation.jpg"/>
                    <p>We had a great time crawling under my kitchen addition with our headlamps.</p>
                    <p>We wrapped my PEX waterline and heating wire with 1/2 foam pipe insulation</p>
                    <p>We got creative and used duct tape and brush-burn-inspired strength to hold it all together. </p>

                    <h4>Project #3- Installing a window with Honna</h4>
                    <img src="images/honnaswindow/framing.jpg" />
                    <p>We removed the window framing and rotted wooden sill down to the brick (saved the top).</p>
                    <p>We then added new wood between the vertical brick, holding it in with metal rods, using pressure from below.</p>

                    <img src="images/honnaswindow/honnahauk.jpg" />
                    <p>Honna tuckpointed the bricks that needed some extra attention.</p>
                    <img src="images/honnaswindow/moreframing.jpg" />
                    <p>We created a new wooden frame for the new concrete sill using the same kind of metal rods as before to hold it in place.</p>
                    <img src="images/honnaswindow/sillframe.jpg" />
                    <p>We mixed concrete and sandmix in a wheelbarrow, and shoveled it into place.</p>

                    <img src="images/honnaswindow/concretecloseup.jpg" />
                    <p>I need to acquire more pictures of the window installation.</p>

                    <h4>Project #4- Installing french doors with Mel</h4>
                    <p>Honna and Bridget are rearing to go.</p>
                    <img src= "images/prefrenchdoors.jpg" />
                    <p>We discovered that hinge depth really does matter as we frustratingly shimmed it with cardboard. </p>
                    <img src= "images/hingedepth.jpg" />
                    <p>We are all feeling very pleased with ourselves. They are great.</p>
